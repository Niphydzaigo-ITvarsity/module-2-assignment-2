                    <p>Game stores are owned by the Massmart Holdings group. Massmart is Africa’s third largest consumer goods distributor. Game is essentially a massive discount retailer specialising in the sale of general merchandise and non-perishables for the home, leisure or business environment.</p>
                    <p>The first Game store opened its doors in 1970 in Durban. It was borne out the belief that shopping had become a boring, tedious activity. The founders wanted to create a fun, pleasurable shopping environment where people could get excited about their trips to the mall.<p>
